You need boost installed. I'm not going to tell you how to do that.
I am obviously tired as I'm starting to mistype commands. Here's
the general workflow with how you should compile, link and run
this bad boy:

(1) Change your nginx.conf to proxy_pass to http://127.0.0.1:9000;
(2) g++ -I/usr/local/include -L/usr/local/lib -lboost_program_options -lboost_system main.cc
(3) ./a.out --port=9000;
(4) Open up the web browser and go;
(5) Override the message with --message, if you so wish.

I need to take a shower and go to work now.

Note:   -O3 flag produces a 284K binary; a 704K binary without.
